# Vignettes explaining SimpleBox

This subfolder contains all vignettes explaining SB concepts, as described in the paper by [Schoorl et al. (2015)](https://www.rivm.nl/bibliotheek/rapporten/2015-0161.html). The vignette structure roughly follows Chapter 3 of this paper. New nano-material additions [e.g. HeteroAgglomeration] are described in the vignettes starting with a 9.

There's three additional vignettes in this folder:

-   [Getting Started](/vignettes/Getting-started.md) : this file includes all basics for users (not necessarily developers) to use and calculate with the R-implementation of SB. 

-   [Vignette_progress](/vignettes/Vignette-progress.md) : tracks all process of the vignettes and if they have been recently tested

-   [x1 Solver use](vignettes/x.1 Solver use.Rmd) : explains how to solve for both static and dynamic data.
