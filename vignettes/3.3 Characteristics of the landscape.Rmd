### Landscape characteristics

In its default settings, SimpleBox represents the Earthâ€™s northern 
hemisphere: continents surrounded by oceans in three climatic zones, 
and continents composed of river catchments, one of which is detailed 
as regional environment. 

#### Initialisation 

```{r preparation, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#First, we initialize the world object
source("baseScripts/initWorld_onlyMolec.R")
```


#### Examples of parameters
Several examples of landscape characteristics are given below. Area characteristics are specifically discussed in vignette 5.1-Area. All units are SI units.

```{r parameters}

# Each scale has its own temperature
World$fetchData("Temp")

##windspeed is constant
World$fetchData("WINDspeed")

## and so is the rain rate
World$fetchData("RAINrate")
