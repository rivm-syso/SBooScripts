# Vignettes explaining SimpleBox

This subfolder contains all vignettes explaining SB concepts, as
described in the paper by [Schoorl et
al. (2015)](https://www.rivm.nl/bibliotheek/rapporten/2015-0161.html).
The vignette structure roughly follows Chapter 3 of this report. New
nano-material additions \[e.g. HeteroAgglomeration\] are described in
the vignettes starting with a 9.

There are three additional vignettes on:

- [Getting Started](/vignettes/Getting-started.md) : this file includes
  all basics for users (not necessarily developers) to use and calculate
  with the R-implementation of SB.

- [10.1 Solver use](/vignettes/10.1-Solver-use.md) : explains how to
  solve for both static and dynamic data.

- [10.2 Probabilistic solver
  use](/vignettes/10.2-Uncertain-solver-use.md) : explains how to solve
  for both static and dynamic data.

- [10.3 Probabilistics Dynamic solver
  use](/vignettes/10.3-Uncertain-dynamic-solver-use.Rmd) : explains how
  to solve for both static and dynamic data.

- [Vignette_progress](/vignettes/Vignette-progress.md) : tracks all
  process of the vignettes and if they have been recently tested
