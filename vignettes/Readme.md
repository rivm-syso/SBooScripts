There are two types of vignettes. Vignettes in the
“SBooScripts/vignettes” folder with chapter numbers describe processes
in SimpleBox. Vignettes in “SBooscripts/vignettes/Development” are meant
to support developers of SimpleBox and describe e.g. best practices for
debugging.

This document is used to track the testing and verification of
vignettes.Please add any new vignette to the overview table below. Indicate in the
“Initial run” column whether an initial run of the script has been
successfully performed, and whether it is thus ready for testing. The
verification column can be used to indicate whether testing has been
performed or is currently in progress.
