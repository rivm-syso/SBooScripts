# Development of SimpleBox object oriented (SBoo)

There are several important conventions takes as basis for development of SimpleBox in R. This folder contains different examples[^1] and other help files aimed at an (advanced) user who wants to extend or modify the current implementation of SBoo.

[^1]: Links are to github documents (.md), but when opening the code in R, the .Rmd files can be used directly and when updated or changes 'knitted' to the md files which are parsed visually on GitHub.

## SBoo

Important starting documents to read:

* [Getting-Started](/vignettes/Getting-started.md) : Although not in this folder, before starting to develop it's wise to understand how SB will be used by most users. In this vignette a default calculation is explained. 
* [Basics for developers](/vignettes/Development/BasicsOfDevelopment.md) : This vignette is a good starting point for starting developers. The underlying structure of the repository is explained here, including the input data. 

All other vignettes are useful for their own specific focus.
