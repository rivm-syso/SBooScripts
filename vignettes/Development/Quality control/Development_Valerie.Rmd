# Development process V de Rijk - logbook

This document will provide details on bug fixes and other
adjustments made to SimpleBox in R and Excel during my
internship at the RIVM-DMG department.

```{r, setup, include=FALSE}

knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width = 8, collapse = TRUE)

```

## Updating of documentation

My first task was to update documentation in user vignettes
and Readme.md files. This is an ongoing process, but one
that is important for the publication of the repositories on
Github. An example of adjustments made is for the initial
Readme.md file in SbooScripts.

*`Initial version`*

`##Vignettes and their use`

`Getting started and participate: start.md`

`The workflow to use and add data and restructuring the csv file before commit: CSVdata.md`

`Making a variable in the SB context: FirstVars.md`

`Creating and checking flows AirFlow.md`

`The workflow to use when adding a k process relative to a compartment, species or scale: processFlow.md`

`An example for adding and testing a new variable: testRainDropRadius.md`

*New updated version*

`# SimpleBox v4.0`

`This repository and its supporting repository [SBOO](https://github.com/rivm-syso/SBoo)`

`are an implementation of the [SimpleBox model](https://www.rivm.nl/publicaties/simplebox-`

`40-a-multimedia-mass-balance-model-for-evaluating-fate-of-chemical-substances), that was`

`previously in Excel. SimpleBox (SB) is a multimedia mass balance model of the so-called`

`'Mackay type'. It simulates environmental fate of chemicals as fluxes (mass flows)`

`between a series of well-mixed boxes of air, water, sediment and soil on regional,`

`continental and global spatial scales. The model is capable of handling chemicals,`

`nanomaterials and plastics.`

`## Installation`

`SB is split over two projects. In order to use SBOO you need two projects with the`

`parent folder in common. This repository and the SBOO repository thus need to be stored`

`in the same folder. The working directory of the project should always be set to this`

`folder. More info on the R-servers at RIVM can be found [here]`

`(http://wiki.rivm.nl/inwiki/bin/view/StatNMod/RStudio%2BServer).`

`### Dependencies`

`Packages needed for both repositories are defined in [requirements](requirements.txt)`

`## Set-Up`

`This repository includes several vignettes detailing both the set-up of the [project]`

`(/vignettes/Development/Readme.md) and theoretical implementation of the [SB Model]`

`(/vignettes/Readme.md).`

`-   The Development folder details the technical construction of the project and is most`

`suitable for developers. The vignette [start](/vignettes/Development/start.md) explains`

`the basics of object-oriented modelling and how this is implemented in this repository.`

`Multiple other vignettes are useful if aiming to develop, such as [CSV-reordering]`

`(/vignettes/Development/CSVdata.Rmd), [creating variables]`

`(vignettes/Development/FirstVars.Rmd), [creating and checking flows]`

`(/vignettes/Development/AirFlow.Rmd), [creating processes]`

`(vignettes/Development/processFlow.Rmd) and [testing new variables]`

`(/vignettes/Development/testRainDropRadius.Rmd).`

`-   The vignette folder outlines the theoretical implementation of the SimpleBox model,`

`following the structure of Chapter 3 in [Schoorl et al. (2015)]`

`(https://www.rivm.nl/bibliotheek/rapporten/2015-0161.html)`

## Testing of SimpleBox4Nano - R vs Excel with nAg_10nm

The initial test presented large absolute and relative
differences.

![Relative differences between flows showing up to
differences in 4e+11.](images/relative%20differences.png)

### Diffusivity

The largest differences were present between flows in air
from Solid to Particulate species (e.g., aAs_AaP) and Solid
to Attached species (e.g., aAs_aAA). These relative
differences were present on all scales. As such, debugging
was needed. The problems seemed to lie with the
implementation of the HeteroAgglomeration.air flux. This is
a complicated function which is dependent on other functions
as well. This led to two observations:

1.  The Excel Version missed multiplication with the
    Cunningham factor for aerosols and other particles that
    were not the analyzed nanoparticle.

2.  The R-version had a bug in f_diffusivity function
    leading to the function returning solely the first part
    of the function.

*R-Version*

The following code was changed from:

```{r}
f_Diffusivity <- function(Matrix, Temp, DynVisc, rad_species, Cunningham = NULL) {
  if(!is.numeric(Temp)){
    warning("Temp missing in f_Diffusivity")
    return(NA)
  }
  if(!is.numeric(DynVisc)){
    warning("DynVisc missing in f_Diffusivity")
    return(NA)
  }
  if(!is.numeric(rad_species)){
    warning("rad_species missing in f_Diffusivity")
    return(NA)
  }
  kboltz <- constants::syms$k
  if (Matrix == "air") {
    if (is.null(Cunningham))
      Cunningham <- f_Cunningham(rad_species)
    return (kboltz*Temp*Cunningham)/(6*pi*DynVisc*rad_species)
  } else {
    (kboltz*Temp)/(6*pi*DynVisc*rad_species)
  }

}
```

to

```{r}
f_Diffusivity <- function(Matrix, Temp, DynVisc, rad_species, Cunningham = NULL) {
  if(!is.numeric(Temp)){
    warning("Temp missing in f_Diffusivity")
    return(NA)
  }
  if(!is.numeric(DynVisc)){
    warning("DynVisc missing in f_Diffusivity")
    return(NA)
  }
  if(!is.numeric(rad_species)){
    warning("rad_species missing in f_Diffusivity")
    return(NA)
  }
  kboltz <- constants::syms$k
  if (Matrix == "air") {
    if (is.null(Cunningham))
      Cunningham <- f_Cunningham(rad_species)
    return ((kboltz*Temp*Cunningham)/(6*pi*DynVisc*rad_species))
  } else {
    (kboltz*Temp)/(6*pi*DynVisc*rad_species)
  }

}
```

This changed the output from:

```         
 3.631107e-21
```

to

```         
7.095256e-11
```

and the relative differences (for one flow comparison from)

| Flow    | R-old    | Excel-Old | Abs difference | Relative Difference | R-new    | Abs difference | Relative difference |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| aAS_aAP | 2.97e-19 | 1.43e-7   | 1.43e-7        | 4.8e+11             | 1.43e-07 | -8.02e-10      | 5.62e-03            |

![Relative differences after
update](images/relative%20differences%20update.png)

*Excel Version*

I changed the Excel version to include the Cunningham factor
for aerosols in all scales by adjusting the formulas. The
adjustments led to the following results within the relative
differences graph, effectively reducing the relative
differences even further.

![](images/update2.png)

Relative differences and absolute differences were still
very large.

### Cloudwater scavenging

The next largest differences were found in the flows
considering aggregated particles in air to aggregated
particles in cloudwater (e.g., aTA_cwTA)

| Flow     | R-old   | Excel-Old | Abs difference | Relative Difference | Excel-New | Abs difference | Relative difference |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| aTA_cwTA | 2.32e-7 | 8.14e-7   | 5.81e-7        | 2.50                | 2.32e-7   | 5.6e-12        | 2.41e-5             |

![Relative differences after cloudwater
scavenging](images/update3.png)

### Dry Deposition

The SimpleBox Excel version has a different way of
implementing Dry Deposition (through constants) and thus
differs from the R version per definition.

Created a function of constant DRYDEPvelocity. This fixes
the discrepancy between the flows for aAP and other Attached
species in air. Leads to exact same flow, so model works
properly.

*Dry Deposition for aggregates*

Settling velocity of particles is implemented different in
Excel and R (Factor 18 instead of 9).

### Heteroagglomerations water and soil (sediment)

The total collection coefficient (a sum of Brownian
collection, interception collection and gravitational
collection) was erroneous in Excel. The Brownian collection
is computed correctly as described in Meesters et al. (2014)
as presented in the next code chunk.

```{r Brownian,include=FALSE}
# ASPDF <- (2*(1-GammPDF^5))/(2-3*GammPDF+3*GammPDF^5-2*GammPDF^6)
# aspectratioSFP <- RadS/RadCP
# PecletNumberFP <- (Udarcy*2*RadCP)/(DiffS.w)
# vdWaalsNumberSFP <- hamakerSP.w/(kboltz*Temp)
#                       
#                       #multiplication by ASPDF, in Excel by Peclet
#                       
# BrownSFP <- 2.4*ASPDF^(1/3)*aspectratioSFP^(-0.081)*PecletNumberFP^-0.715*vdWaalsNumberSFP^0.053
```

However, in Excel, the first term in BrownSFP (in most
scales) replaced ASPDF by PecletNumberFP, causing a faulty
value. When this was fixed, the discrepancy was also fixed.
In some other cells, ASPDF was replaced by porosity, this
also fixed the discrepancy.

### Sedimentation

An issue considering the flow from sea to deepocean is
caused by the fact that it includes both sedimentation and
advection (as one flow). The R version only has a working
advection flow. It should be split in two flows (advection
and sedimentation). This caused the following discrepancy.

| Flow      | R-old   | Excel-Old | Abs difference | Relative Difference | Excel-New | Abs difference | Relative difference |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| w2TP_w3TP | 2.27e-7 | 5.21e-7   | 2.94e-7        | 1.29                |           |                |                     |

### Heteroagglomeration

The flux from particles to aggregated particles were not
consistent between Excel and R was inconsistent, see table
below.

| Flow        | R-Old   | Excel-Old | Abs difference | Relative difference | R-New   | Abs difference | Relative difference |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| sd1CS_sd1CA | 1.13e-1 | 2.25e-3   | 1.1e-1         | 9.8e-1              | 2.25e-3 | 2.92e-10       | 1.29e-7             |

The problem was in the fact that colloid concentration
differed 1e2 and the fact that the colloid concentration in
sd is multiplied by 2 in the Excel script, but not always
consistently; Issue #85. Changed this in the R version by
adapting the data to multiply (and change the factor 100).

\*Heteroagglomeration on Arctic Scale)

In Excel, the calculation of the Peclet number differed in
the heteroagglomeration flux because it referred to the
wrong scale (diffusivity in Water on continental scale
instead of respective global scales). Fixed this.

### Correction factor for erosion

In the R version, a correction factor is applied to consider
the fact that erosion mostly happens in the top soil. In
Excel, this is also implemented but only for flows where
both erosion and runoff are concerned. In cases where
particles are attached, and so only erosion happens, this is
not implemented. This is adjusted in Excel since it should
be there as well.

| Flow      | R-Old    | Excel-Old | Abs difference | Relative difference | Excel-New | Abs difference | Relative difference |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| s2CP_w1CP | 1.09e-11 | 4.36e-12  | 6.36e-12       | 6.03e-1             | 1.01e-11  | 9.134260e-13   | 8.3e-2              |

### Resuspension from sediment to continental sea

There was a discrepancy between the two flows. This was
caused by the fact that the NET sedimentation rate for
continental seas was put to 0. When this was fixed, the
following flow was also fixed, but there is probably another
mistake

| Flow       | R-Old  | Excel-Old | Abs difference | Relative difference | R-New   | Abs difference | Relative difference |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| sd2CA_w2CA | 9.8e-9 | 8.73e-9   | 1.06e-9        | 1.09e-1             | 8.88e-9 | 1.55e-10       | 1.74e-2             |

Found other mistake. Settling velocity of Suspended
Particles in Excel is calculated by =2.5/(24\*3600) instead
of Stokes, leading to a discrepancy.

### Function correction factor water percentage of runoff to.subcompartment

In Excel, an update was created that corrected for the
compartment runoff is flowing towards to in the following
way: (Area_runoff_to)/ (Total water area). This is only
valid for the scales Regional and Continental. This was not
yet implemented in R. To this extent I created the following
variable:

```{r Fraction Runoff}
FracROWatComp <- function(all.landFRAC, all.Matrix, Matrix, SubCompartName, ScaleName) {
  compFrac <- all.landFRAC$landFRAC[all.landFRAC$SubCompart == SubCompartName & all.landFRAC$Scale ==  ScaleName]
  all.landFrac <- as.tibble(all.landFRAC)
  all.Matrix <- as.tibble(all.Matrix)
  mergeddata <- left_join(
    x = all.landFRAC,
    y = all.Matrix,
    by = join_by(SubCompart))

  if ((Matrix == "water") & (ScaleName %in% c("Regional", "Continental"))) {
    # total landfrac of (fresh) water compartments
    waterFrac <- mergeddata |>
      filter(Matrix == "water" & Scale == ScaleName) |>
      summarise(waterFrac = sum(landFRAC, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
      pull(waterFrac)
    return(compFrac / waterFrac)
  } else {
    return(1)
  }
}
```

## Testing of SimpleBox4Plastic

Did not work, missing data in SubstanceSubCompartSpeciesData. Needs all input variables explicitly defined. In the end, needs to be fixed through a variable, but for now need to adjust this. 

- Did fix discrepancies for nTiO2_10nm
