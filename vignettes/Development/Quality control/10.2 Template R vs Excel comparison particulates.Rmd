*SimpleBox 4.0 produces two sorts of output; a steady-state or "level
III" output, and the quasi-dynamic or "level IV" output. The
steady-state output is developed when the conditions (loadings and
environmental conditions) remain constant in time for a sufficiently
long period. The mass flows and concentrations are constant in time, as
the sum of the mass balance equation terms is equal to zero for all
boxes, and the n steady-state concentrations can be solved from the n
linear mass balance equations. This steady-state solution is obtained by
means of a matrix inversion routine. The mass flows and concentrations
that characterise this steady state are given in output tables. The
quasi-dynamic output is developed when, after a change in conditions
(loadings or environmental conditions), the mass flows and
concentrations develop toward a new steady state, according to the mass
balance equations. This computation is made by numerical integration of
the set of mass balance equations from time zero, with all
concentrations at zero, to infinite time with all concentrations
constant at steady state. The standard procedure is to compute the
steady-state solution first and carry out the dynamic response
computation afterwards, as an option.*

# *Initialize*

*This vignettes demonstrates the mechanism behind SBoo. The model first
needs to be initialized. Before initialisation a substances needs to be
selected, otherwise the "default stubstance" is used. initWorld.R does
just that, and calculates SBvars, flows and k's.*

*Why are these compartments in SB-R instance: \>
diagonal*$from[!diagonal$*from %in% diagonal_excel\$from] [1] "s2A"
"s2M" "s2T" "s3A" "s3M" "s3T" "sd0A" "sd0C" "sd0M" "sd0R" "sd0T" "sd1A"
"sd1M" "sd1T" "w0A" "w0M" "w0T" "w1A" "w1M" "w1T" [21] "w3C" "w3R"*

*This is due to the degradation rate constant being calculated for all
combinations of subcompartments. There is currently no data sheet where
the exclusion based on combination of subcompartment and scale can be
set. So these types of exclusions are needed in the process function
itself.*

*So now the compartments are the correct amount based on fixing
exclusions in k_Degradation.*

#If you want to inspect per process instead of fromto box: look at the original kaas dataframe

```

## *air*

*Some testing needed to see why K's from air are so different from those
in Excel.*

1.  *The Fringas in excel had an error, was using variables from
    Moderate scale, fix in Excel.*

2.  *k_Escape was being converted to seconds twice! Units conversion is
    enough, no need to cope with such conversions in process algorithms.
    All calculation data should be in SI units.*

3.  *k_Adsorption was using Area which should have been to.Area*

*Checked: k_Degradation, k_Escape, k_Advection, Deposition and
adsorption.*

```{r testing_aA, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}

               fromSpecies == "Unbound"&
                 fromSubCompart == "air")


```

## *water*

*Issue w0R was linked to Excel error using sea water instead of
freshwater to sea water flow to calculate w0 to w1 water flow.*

Several K's exist in R that are not read out as such from excel.
reasons:

1.  There is in the reference excel no lake sediment (sd0) at regional
    and continental scale

2.  There are 0's in the k's such as for certain advective flows in
    excel.
