*SimpleBox 4.0 produces two sorts of output; a steady-state or "level
III" output, and the quasi-dynamic or "level IV" output. The
steady-state output is developed when the conditions (loadings and
environmental conditions) remain constant in time for a sufficiently
long period. The mass flows and concentrations are constant in time, as
the sum of the mass balance equation terms is equal to zero for all
boxes, and the n steady-state concentrations can be solved from the n
linear mass balance equations. This steady-state solution is obtained by
means of a matrix inversion routine. The mass flows and concentrations
that characterise this steady state are given in output tables. The
quasi-dynamic output is developed when, after a change in conditions
(loadings or environmental conditions), the mass flows and
concentrations develop toward a new steady state, according to the mass
balance equations. This computation is made by numerical integration of
the set of mass balance equations from time zero, with all
concentrations at zero, to infinite time with all concentrations
constant at steady state. The standard procedure is to compute the
steady-state solution first and carry out the dynamic response
computation afterwards, as an option.*

# *Initialize*

*This vignettes demonstrates the mechanism behind SBoo. The model first
needs to be initialized. Before initialisation a substances needs to be
selected, otherwise the "default stubstance" is used. initWorld.R does
just that, and calculates SBvars, flows and k's.*

*This is due to the degradation rate constant being calculated for all
combinations of subcompartments. There is currently no data sheet where
the exclusion based on combination of subcompartment and scale can be
set. So these types of exclusions are needed in the process function
itself.*

*So now the compartments are the correct amount based on fixing
exclusions in k_Degradation.*

# In R however, the gasabs is calculated using the FRorig_spw for each specific soil type. By using the 'Test' variable, it was
# possible to temporarly change the FRorig_spw and FRorig in R to the value used in Excel. This fixed the large relative difference for this
# flux between excel and R. Conclusion: GASABS (used to calculate k_Adsorption) in R is calculated specifically for each
