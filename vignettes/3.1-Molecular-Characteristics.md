### 3.1 Molecular Characteristics

#### Properties of molecules

Properties related to the substance directly are all contained in csv
files that serve as the input data for SimpleBox. These can be accessed
after initializing the SimpleBox world. Each property is accessed by a
key, which is dependent on the amount of detail that is required for the
property of the substance (e.g. a property that is dependent on both the
SubCompartment and the Scale would need both of these keys to be
accessesed). First, let’s initialize the World object:

``` r
#we choose a random molecule to initialize the world 
substance <- "1-aminoanthraquinone" 
#different worlds exist representing the processes for molecules, particulates and plastics. In this instance we create a world for molecules. 
source("baseScripts/initWorld_onlyMolec.R")
```

All substance data, as mentioned before, is saved in csv files. An
example of this is the substances csv, where global substance-specific
data is located. Here, we filter on a specifical Chemical Class (*Acid*)

``` r
read_csv("data/Substances.csv") |> filter(ChemClass == "Acid") 
```

    ## Rows: 1045 Columns: 22
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr  (3): Substance, ChemClass, Shape
    ## dbl (19): X, pKa, MW, Tm, Pvap25, Sol25, Kaw25, Kow, Ksw, Kp.col, Kp.susp, K...
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

    ## # A tibble: 0 × 22
    ## # ℹ 22 variables: Substance <chr>, X <dbl>, ChemClass <chr>, pKa <dbl>,
    ## #   MW <dbl>, Tm <dbl>, Pvap25 <dbl>, Sol25 <dbl>, Kaw25 <dbl>, Kow <dbl>,
    ## #   Ksw <dbl>, Kp.col <dbl>, Kp.susp <dbl>, Kp.sed <dbl>, Kp.soil <dbl>,
    ## #   RadS <dbl>, RhoS <dbl>, hamakerSP.w <dbl>, Shape <chr>, Longest_side <dbl>,
    ## #   Intermediate_side <dbl>, Shortest_side <dbl>

#### Accessing properties

Properties of the substance (and the world) that are constants (or
calculated as a variable) can be accessed by the command
World\$fetchData(). An example is given below for some molecular
properties.

``` r
# First, we check a world property, namely the amount of rainwater that becomes runoff
FracRun <- World$fetchData("FRACrun")
print(paste("Frac run is:", FracRun))
```

    ## [1] "Frac run is: 0.25"

``` r
#Next, we choose a parameter that is molecule specific, namely the partitioning coefficient Kow
Kow <- World$fetchData("Kow")
print(Kow)
```

    ## [1] 160

#### Accessing calculated variables

As mentioned before you can also access calculated variables (as long as
they’re not functions). An example here is given:

``` r
## We choose settling velocity as an example 

SettlingVelocity <- World$fetchData("SettlVelocitywater")
print(SettlingVelocity)
```

    ##         Scale SettlVelocitywater
    ## 1      Arctic           2.89e-05
    ## 2 Continental           2.89e-05
    ## 3    Moderate           2.89e-05
    ## 4    Regional           2.89e-05
    ## 5      Tropic           2.89e-05
