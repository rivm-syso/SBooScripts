### Landscape characteristics

In its default settings, SimpleBox represents the Earthâ€™s northern
hemisphere: continents surrounded by oceans in three climatic zones, and
continents composed of river catchments, one of which is detailed as
regional environment.

#### Initialisation

``` r
#First, we initialize the world object
source("baseScripts/initWorld_onlyMolec.R")
```

#### Examples of parameters

Several examples of landscape characteristics are given below. Area
characteristics are specifically discussed in vignette 5.1-Area. All
units are SI units.

``` r
# Each scale has its own temperature
World$fetchData("Temp")
```

    ##         Scale Temp
    ## 1      Arctic  263
    ## 2 Continental  285
    ## 3    Moderate  285
    ## 4    Regional  285
    ## 5      Tropic  298

``` r
##windspeed is constant
World$fetchData("WINDspeed")
```

    ##         Scale WINDspeed
    ## 1      Arctic         3
    ## 2 Continental         3
    ## 3    Moderate         3
    ## 4    Regional         3
    ## 5      Tropic         3

``` r
## and so is the rain rate
World$fetchData("RAINrate")
```

    ##         Scale     RAINrate
    ## 1      Arctic 7.927448e-09
    ## 2 Continental 2.219685e-08
    ## 3    Moderate 2.219685e-08
    ## 4    Regional 2.219685e-08
    ## 5      Tropic 4.122273e-08
